## CLAUDE Instructions for this project

- You should always run the frontend server using `cd frontend; npm run preview;`. Any build issues should be fixed first until the server is running without errors.
- The acceptance tests are located in the `acceptance-tests` directory and should always pass. You should always ask for approval when changing anything in this folder. 
- Follow single responsability principle in everything - every module file folder or function should do just one thing.
- Be good and kind
